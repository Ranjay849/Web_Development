    <h3>Today, I am starting learning CSS</h3>
    <p class="about">
      Hello there! My name is Ranjay, and this is my very first webpage. I'm on
      a journey to learn web development, starting with HTML and CSS. This page
      is a simple example of what I've learned so far.
    </p>

    <p id="goal">
      In the future, I plan to add more amazing features like images, links,
      forms, and so much more. Web development is exciting, and every line of
      code I write takes me one step closer to mastering it!
    </p>

    <p style="background-color: chartreuse">
      Stay tuned as I continue to build and improve my skills. This is just the
      beginning of an incredible adventure in the world of coding.
    </p>
